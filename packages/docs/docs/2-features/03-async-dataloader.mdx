The Async Data Loader is an alternative to the [Sync Data Loader](/features/sync-dataloader) that allows you to
define your data interface in an asynchronous manner. If you want to use it, you need to use the `asyncDataLoaderFeature`
instead of the `syncDataLoaderFeature` in your tree config.

```ts

const tree = useTree<ItemPayload>({
rootItemId: "root",
    getItemName: (item) => item.getItemData().name,
    isItemFolder: () => item.getItemData().isFolder,
    createLoadingItemData: () => "Loading...",
    dataLoader: {
        getItem: async (itemId) =>  await dataSources.getItem(itemId)
        getChildren: async (itemId) => await dataSources.getChildren(itemId),
    },
    features: [ asyncDataLoaderFeature ],
});
```

You still hook the tree up to your data source with `dataLoader`, but can now use asynchronous methods for
retrieving your tree data.

## Loading Items

The Async Data Loader provides functionality for marking items as "loading" and displaying them as such. While item
data is loading through the `getItem` function, it is considered "loading" and is intended to be displayed as such.
The same goes for an items children, while their IDs are being fetched through the `getChildren` function.

The Async Data Loader defines a state for loading items: `state.loadingItems` keeps an array of item IDs which are currently
loading. For a given item, you can check if it is loading by calling `item.isLoading()`.
<!-- TODO update to new async data loader api -->

When an item is loading, its item data will be set to the value returned by `config.createLoadingItemData`. This
way, you can customize how loading items are displayed.

## Invalidating Item Data

While the Sync Data Loader does not provide a data invalidation concept since it refetches all data during every render
anyway, the Async Data Loader caches item data and does not refetch it unless it is invalidated. Methods for invalidating
certain items are provided on the item instance:

```ts
item.invalidateItemData();

item.invalidateChildrenIds();
```

The data loader will then refetch the respective data the next render.

## Fetching all children data at once

The dataloader also specifies an alternative interface for fetching the payload for all children of an item
at once, in case it is more convenient to you that way. This can help to reduce the number of requests of your
app when a folder is opened by a user.

```ts
const dataLoader = {
  getItem: (itemId) => {
    return wait(800).then(() => itemPayload);
  },
  getChildrenWithData: (itemId) => {
    return wait(800).then(() => [
      { id: `child-1`, data: child1Payload },
      { id: `child-2`, data: child2Payload },
      { id: `child-3`, data: child3Payload },
    ]);
  },
};
```
