Headless Tree is the official successor of React-Complex-Tree. Migration might not be straight-forward,
since React Complex Tree did most of the rendering out of the box, whereas Headless Tree expects you
to write the DOM rendering yourself. However, Headless Tree is much more flexible, which means you will
likely find an easy solution to most aspects of how you did things in RCT.

## Feature parity

Headless Tree has full feature parity to React Complex Tree except for the following features:

- Keyboard-based drag and drop is not yet supported (planned, coming soon)

## Benefits of Headless Tree

- Headless Tree is compatible with virtualization libraries
- Much better performance with large trees, supporting several 100k visible items in virtualized trees
- The rendered DOM is easier to customize since you manage it yourself
- Headless Tree is more flexible and [easier to expand](/recipe/plugins)
- Hotkeys can not just be remapped, but also customized in their implementation, and
  you can [define your additional hotkeys](/guides/hotkeys#adding-custom-hotkeys)
- Mostly Framework agnostic, support for more frameworks is planned

## Main Differences

- Headless Tree exposes functionality with a React Hook, instead of a component.
- There are no out-of-the-box renderers anymore. You need to implement the render logic yourself, though
  that is usually not more than 20-30 LOC.
- The concept of [controlled](https://rct.lukasbach.com/docs/guides/controlled-environment) and [uncontrolled trees](https://rct.lukasbach.com/docs/guides/uncontrolled-environment)
  doesn't exist anymore. Instead, you can control [none](/guides/state#letting-headless-tree-manage-the-state),
  [all](/guides/state#manage-the-entire-state-yourself) or [some individual state atoms](/guides/state#managing-individual-feature-states).
- Instead of using `StaticTreeDataProvider` or implementing a custom `TreeDataProvider`, you need to implement a
  [`TreeDataLoader`](/api/core/interface/TreeDataLoader).
- Propagating data mutation as consequence of drop events is no longer achieved as part of the `TreeDataProvider`,
  but can be done in the drop handler with the [`createOnDropHandler`](/dnd/overview#mutating-your-data-after-the-drop).
- When using asynchronous data loading, you need to use the [async data loader feature](/features/async-dataloader)
  instead of the [sync data loader](/features/sync-dataloader).
- The old [interaction modes](https://rct.lukasbach.com/docs/guides/interaction-modes), that customize which click
  behavior expands/selects/focuses items, does not exist anymore. Instead, you can customize this with
  [a custom feature that overwrites the click behavior](/recipe/click-behavior).
- [Drag-interactions between multiple trees on the same page](https://rct.lukasbach.com/docs/guides/multiple-trees)
  is not supported out of the box, the concept of tree environments doesn't exist anymore. You can achieve this
  by [defining an outgoing DnD interface](/dnd/foreign-dnd#interactions-between-multiple-instances-of-headless-tree).
  - This can also be used to allow your tree to [accept drag events from outside](/dnd/foreign-dnd#dragging-foreign-objects-inside-of-tree),
    or [drag your tree items into other components](/dnd/foreign-dnd#dragging-tree-items-out-of-tree), which wasn't
    supported before.
- Almost all features are not included by default, but are seperate variables that [need to be imported explicitly](/getstarted#importing-features).
  This reduces the bundle size to only what you need.
- [When using the Search Feature, you need to render the search input](/features/search).
- [When using the Renaming Feature, you need to render the rename input](/features/renaming).
