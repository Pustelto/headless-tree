Proxy Item Instances are an advanced concept, and is only required if you handle a large number of items
that is loaded in at the same time. Usually this happens in situations where also [virtualization](/recipe/virtualization)
is employed. It is suggested to only use this feature if you already notice a performance impact of memory
usage with the default implementation.

Whenever Headless Tree reacts to changes in the tree structure, e.g. items are expanded or collapsed, or the tree
structure is mutated (or more specifically, whenever `tree.rebuildTree()` is called), an item instance object
is created for every item that is part of the tree. This object will contain a reference to every tree item function of every
feature that is included in the tree. Both the instantiation of the item and keeping it in memory is generally
a trivial overhead, but with many hundreds or thousands or millions of items, this can still cause a noticable
memory usage.

The instantiation of tree items is a configurable method, that can be defined with the `instanceBuilder` option.
This defaults to the `buildStaticInstance` method exposed by Headless Tree, which creates a new static object
with all the tree item functions resolved inside.

An alternative is the `buildProxiedInstance` method, which creates a proxy object that will only resolve individual
tree item functions when they are actually called. This reduces memory, since now every item is only a very thin
proxy object, and all feature-related functions are only maintained in memory once instead of n times.

```ts
import {
  buildProxiedInstance,
  buildStaticInstance,
} from "@headless-tree/core";
```

```ts
const tree = useTree({
  // ...remaining tree options
  instanceBuilder: buildProxiedInstance,
});
```

This will already do everything needed to use proxy instances instead of the default static instances. The most
notable difference is, that now function references in item instances are not stable anymore:

```ts
const item = tree.getItemInstance("some-id");

item.getId === item.getId; // This will be true with static instances, but false with proxied instances
```

The results of executing those methods will of course not be affected. Don't confuse this with the behavior of
the [Prop Memoization Feature](/features/propmemoization), which will memoize the props of the tree item functions,
i.e. the results of calling the `item.getProps()` method, which is not related to this topic.
