The default behavior of Headless Tree resembles the UX behavior of a VSCode Filetree: Clicking on an item
will both focus it and make it the sole selection. Control-clicking will add the item to an existing selection.
If the clicked item is also a folder, it will toggle its expanded-state.

This can be customized very easily by overwriting the generation of the `onClick` (and `onDoubleClick` if you want) handlers
for generated props of tree items. This expands on the idea that was introduced in the [Guide on Plugins](/recipe/plugins)
by allowing you to write a small custom plugin that overwrites the behavior of other Headless Tree core features.

## Expand on Double Click

In the following sample, the behavior is changed so that folders are only expanded or collapsed on double-click,
and the primary action handler is also bound to double-click instead of the typical single-click.

Note that we completely overwrite the `onClick` handler here, so we need to re-implement the selection behavior
even if it remains unchanged. We do not need to re-implement other props that are generated for tree items,
since we integrate the existing functionality of other features with the `prev?.()` call.
If we were to expand the `onClick` behavior instead of overwriting it, we could also expand instead of overwrite
the `onClick` handler with `prev?.()?.onClick?.(e)`, as is being done in the
[actual implementation of the selection feature](https://github.com/lukasbach/headless-tree/blob/7f50c2e380f3455c4dfd0413e609ba96b1338fe7/packages/core/src/features/selection/feature.ts#L93).

## Expand on Arrow-Click

Similar to the previous sample, in the following code snippet we completely remove the expand/collapse behavior
from the `onClick` handler of tree items, and render dedicated arrow buttons that can be clicked to expand or collapse
the tree items instead.
